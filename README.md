Navier-Stokes
------------
By emilssipols11

# Description
This project is an attempt to solve the famous Navier-Stokes equations in order to simulate fluids.

Note: this is not a fully finished implementation, unfortunately this is only how far I could get with solving the equations by myself :(

The setup is a square container with a stream of particles coming in from the top left that attempts to simulate fluid flowing into a container.

# Setup
 Download the .java files and move them into your projects source directory. The project also uses a C++ based visual library sfml that was rewritten in Java as jsfml and also the colt library for scientific and technical Computing in Java. Download the jsfml.jar and colt.jar files and add them as a libraries to your project. After that run the main method in App.java.
